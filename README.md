 This is a basic web app using the Spotify API. You can clone this repo to see it work. However, The Spotify API will need a clientId and clientSecret in order to give you permission to make requests and get some data back. To get clientId and clientSecret, you have to register the app on the official Spotify Developers website (you won't be charged for this, and no credit card information will be required). Let's follow these steps:
 Navigate to Spotify Developers.

1. Navigate to https://developer.spotify.com
2. Click on the "Log In" button. If you do not have an account, you will be asked to create one, itÂ´s free ðŸ˜‰ .

3. After logging in, open the Dashboard page by clicking on "Dashboard" in the menu or by visiting https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard.

4. Once on the Dashboard page, click the Create App button. You might need to verify your email before proceeding.
5. Fill in the fields and submit the form.
6. After creating the app, go to the Settings page to find your Client ID and Client Secret. Keep these two values handy as you will need them in the next step.
